- Clicking the `Study` button will take the user to the Study screen, `decks/:deckId/study`, where the user can begin to study the cards in that deck.
- Clicking the `Delete` button will prompt a warning message to appear, and give the user the option to delete the deck or cancel this action.

### Delete Deck Prompt:
When the user clicks on the `Delete` button associated with a particular deck, a warning message is shown. The user can either click
`OK` or `Cancel`. If the user clicks `OK`, the deck is deleted and will no longer be visible on the Home page.
